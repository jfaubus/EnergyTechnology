# EnergyTechnology

A study of the number of patents for different energy technology from 2015 to 2021 because of the importance of energy in our society. I chose solar energy and bioenergy because those were the two most prominent categories in the set from the International Renewable Energy Agency [1]. Additionally, I chose subcategories for both (I.E. photovoltaic, thermal, and PV thermal hybrid for solar power and biofuels and fuel from waste for bio energy).
